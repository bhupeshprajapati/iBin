        <i>i-Bin </i>is a smart waste management system. We are going to 
        clean our surroundings while building a community of highly motivated 
        individuals.

        <u><h2>What's wrong?</h2></u>
        <p style="font-size:19px" class="paragraph">There is no segregation of waste in many cities.
        Dumping yards are full and dumping management is poor.
        Municipal corporation–waste–public relations are not so good
                because there is no direct contact of municipe corporations with public. <br>
        Recognition of private organizations and  self-funded organizations is not a
                priority of any of the governmental departments and due to this these NGOs suffier from many kinds of hardships
                such as economical or finantial crises even after delivering good work. <br>
        Public awareness about waste is not up to the mark people now also don't know how to handle different types of wastes.
        There is a sever shortage of public motivations in cleaniliness drives aross the cities.
        </p>
